This project uses data from Warby Parker - one of America's leading online eyewear retailers.

Part 1 is a funnel of users clicking through a questionnaire to spot drop-off, Part 2 is an A/B Test of an experiment carried out by the company to try to increase sales.

This project uses pandas, the SQL extension in Jupyter Notebooks, and evaluates the outcome of the A/B Test with a binomial test via SciPy.
